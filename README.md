   2. Press enter.
3. Then you will be asked to enter your grade.
   - Depending on what qualification you are doing, these options can be numbers or strings.
   - An example of distinction star would be written as "A*" with an astrix.
   - An example of "A star A", would be written as "A*A" with an astrix in the middle.

   2. Press enter.
4. You will then be presented with the points conversion that your grade equates to.
